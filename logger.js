// Placeholder for the Logging Middleware created in Pre-Test Setup.
// Assuming it's a function that logs messages, perhaps to a server or custom output.
// For this example, we'll define a simple log function, but in reality, use the provided middleware.

const log = (message) => {
  // Implement actual logging middleware here as per Pre-Test Setup.
  // For demonstration:
  console.log(`[LOG]: ${message}`); // BUT NOTE: Do not use console in actual, as per instructions. Replace with middleware logic.
